One day, a donkey and an eagle were having a discussion. The donkey insisted that the grass was blue, while the eagle confidently argued that the grass was green. 
 
Frustrated, the donkey suggested they take the matter to the lion, the king of the jungle, to settle the dispute once and for all. 
 
They approached the lion, and the donkey immediately began complaining: 
“Your Majesty, isn’t it true that the grass is blue?” 
 
The lion looked at the donkey and said, “Yes, the grass is blue.” 
 
The donkey was overjoyed and continued: 
“The eagle disagrees with me and insists that the grass is green! He should be punished!” 
 
The lion thought for a moment, then declared: 
“The eagle will be punished with three days of silence.” 
 
The donkey, pleased with himself, happily trotted away, satisfied that he had won the argument. 
 
Once they were alone, the eagle asked the lion: 
“Your Majesty, why did you say the grass is blue? You and I both know it’s green!” 
 
The lion calmly replied: 
“Indeed, the grass is green. But punishing you has nothing to do with the color of the grass. The punishment is for wasting your time arguing with someone who refuses to see reason.” 
 
 
 
1. Beware of the “Grass is Blue” Argument in Software Architecture 
 
Just as the donkey insisted that grass was blue, some engineers or architects cling to outdated, inefficient, or poorly designed systems—not because they’re the best solution, but because they’re familiar, comfortable, or politically advantageous. These individuals may reject well-reasoned alternatives, no matter how much evidence is presented. 
 
2. Arguing with the Wrong People Drains Energy and Slows Progress 
 
When discussing software architecture, not everyone is interested in the best technical solution. Some may resist change to protect their own past decisions, maintain control, or avoid extra work. Engaging in endless debates with such individuals only increases tech debt instead of solving problems. 
 
3. Maintaining the Status Quo Often Means Preserving Bad Design 
 
The lion (experienced architect) recognizes that wasting time arguing with the donkey (status quo defenders) only delays meaningful progress. In software architecture, clinging to outdated designs often means: 
 
Accumulating unnecessary complexity 
 
Creating technical debt that future teams will struggle with 
 
Blocking innovation and preventing scalability 
 
 
Sometimes, the worst systems survive not because they work well, but because people refuse to challenge them effectively. 
 
Final Thought: Silence is Not Defeat, It’s Strategy 
 
Like the eagle receiving “punishment” in silence, sometimes the best response is not wasting energy on endless debates. Instead, focus on delivering incremental improvements, documenting tech debt, and aligning with leadership to push for meaningful architectural change.
